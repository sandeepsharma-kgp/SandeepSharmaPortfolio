<h1>Hello, I'm Sandeep Sharma.</h1>
	

	<h1>The True Me</h1>

	The journey of life came on October 2nd, 1993. That was the day my parents blessed me with the name Sandeep Sharma. The path my life has taken so far has been a steady one with very few times that I’ve gone off course. I look at my life as a gift and try my hardest not to take it for granted. The years I have spent on this earth have been more than amazing and I imagine they are more than I could have ever asked for. I spend the majority of my time with the ones I love most, like my family and closest friends. They are the ones that keep my head on straight and help me succeed at the goals I set for myself. If it weren’t for the people who love me the most and the fortunate home I have grown up in I don’t know where in the world I would be today. </p>

	As I said before, I spend most of my hours with my family and closest friends. My friends are my backbone and my family is my strength and wisdom. There are three girl friends in my life that I spend every waking moment with. These three girls are Lauren Strange, Annalise Lorge, and my sister Jessica Rogers. They are my best friends and they are the ones that help me in hard times and hold me up when I need the extra support. That is why I consider them my “backbone”. Also, like a lot of people I live in what some would refer to as a “broken home” due to the fact my parents are divorced. It is a problem that faces many people day to day but I find that it has made me stronger emotionally. Not only do my family’s problems give me emotional strength but it gives me wisdom as well. I have learned how to deal with troubling situations more efficiently now due to this.

	It’s obvious that my family and friends mean more than anything to me but there are other things in my life that I have a deep passion for. These things include dance, poms, and my ambition to succeed in life. I am a dancer at Glenn’s School of Dance in Howell and am a member of their Junior Competition team. During the week, if I’m not at pom practice or doing homework I am doing what I love dearly…dancing. Since dancing is such a big part of my life I take part in poms as well, since poms is based around dance. I have been doing poms since I was 8 years old and I am now on the Pinckney Varsity Pom Team. As I continue onto college I do hope that my dance career continues. I believe that without a doubt I will take dance classes for as long as I live. Outside of my friendships and dance though there is still my biggest goal in life. That goal is to be a successful, independent woman when I move beyond my own home. I aspire to attend either Duke University or University of Michigan after high school and have a doctorate degree in Psychology. One day I will have my own practice and with the money I earn I will help those of the third-world. 

That’s my life in a nut-shell but if you want to know more about the real me continue on throughout this website!
